# Customer Churn Prediction App

This is a Streamlit-based web application for predicting customer churn. The app uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model and various preprocessing tools to make predictions based on user input.

## Features

- **User Input**: Collects data from users through a web interface.
- **Preprocessing**: Uses pre-trained label encoders and scalers to preprocess user input.
- **Prediction**: Utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow model to predict customer churn.
